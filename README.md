A collection of keybindings, theme customisations, packages and settings for [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) intended for web development.

## Getting started

1.  Install [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation).
2.  Clone or download this repository to your `Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/` directory and restart Sublime. Optionally, open the console (`Ctrl+'`) to view the installation status of new packages.
4.  To share the same configuration over multiple computers, [Package Syncing](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Package%20Syncing) is highly recommended.
