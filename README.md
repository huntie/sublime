# Sublime Text configuration

Personal key mappings, packages, snippets and preferences for [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/).

## Usage

Place contents under the `Packages/User/` directory, or alternatively link Sublime with the folder locally using [Package Syncing](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Package%20Syncing).

On Linux, this is preconfigured in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/huntie/dotfiles) repository.
