# Sublime configuration

I use [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) nearly every day and over time have maintained a thought-out collection of installed packages and settings. Along with the excellent [Spacegray](http://kkga.github.io/spacegray/) theme these include a bunch of visual customisations and keyboard shortcuts, but mostly I make use of plugins that extend editor functionality and which help with additional web languages and frameworks. Some custom build systems have also been included, although I'd usually set up something project-specific.

## Getting started

1.  [Install Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) if you don't have it already. Some plugins will require Sublime Text 3.
2.  Clone or download this repository following one of the below methods:
    -   [Package Syncing](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Package%20Syncing) is highly recommended if you want to share the same configuration over multiple computers. Clone this repo into a synced folder, copying the path, before selecting `Package Syncing: Define Sync Folder` from the command palette. Paste in the folder path and Sublime will immediately load and apply the new configuration.
    -   Alternatively, clone this repo directly into your Sublime Text `Packages/User/` directory and then restart Sublime.
3.  Optionally, open the console (`Ctrl+'`) to view the installation status of new packages.
